Bakery
======

Use a Pi to make a Pi

WARNING 1
---------

This software is designed to wipe and write to any SD card that you connect via
the USB connectors on a Raspberry Pi. There is obviously a real danger of data
loss if used without care.

WARNING 2
---------

Did you read WARNING 1? If not, go back and read it again.

Hardware Requirements
---------------------

* USB to SD adapter
* PiFace Digital
* USB drive (optional)

The PiFace Digital is used for interaction and feedback so the Bakery can be
used without the need for a screen. Interaction using other add-on hardware can
be used in its place, subject to the necessary code changes.

The USB drive will be used to store the image files. This is not required if
the main SD card is sufficiently large.

Objective
---------

Use the Raspberry Pi to write images to other SD cards. The primary objective
is to be able create new Raspberry Pi OS cards but it can obviously be used for
copying any images.

To do
-----

1 Actually write the code! This README is really just a declaration of intent.
2 Get a PiFace Display. This would be much more useful than the PiFace Digital.
