This is a sample images directory containing no images. It is here to give an idea of how post install scripts should look.

A minimal image prepared for Bakery can be found here:

* https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2puRViVLpKsRXhHS0REWTl3Nnc/edit?usp=sharing

which is a customised version of:

* http://moebiuslinux.sourceforge.net/

It should be put inside the Bakery directory alongside the files:

* bakery.post.1
* bakery.post.2
* bakery.post.3

These will do the necessary configuration.
